# Database Management Systems Lab 2.2

This repository contains my work for the Database Management Systems (DBMS) Lab course, specifically focused on practical implementations of various database concepts. 

## Project Overview

In this lab, I developed multiple SQL scripts and functions to demonstrate core DBMS functionalities. The primary goal was to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world database scenarios, including:

- Database creation and management
- Data manipulation and retrieval using SQL
- Implementing normalization techniques
- Designing and creating relational databases

## Features

- Comprehensive SQL scripts for different DBMS operations.
- Implementation of various database concepts such as:
  - Creating tables with appropriate constraints
  - Performing CRUD operations
  - Querying data with JOIN operations

## Getting Started

To run the SQL scripts:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open your preferred SQL database management tool.
3. Execute the SQL scripts in your database environment.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my understanding of database management systems through practical exercises. I aim to enhance my skills further by working on more complex database projects.
